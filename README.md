# About Relaticle

**Perfect for:** Laravel developers, agencies, and SMBs who need a modern CRM they can customize and self-host.

Relaticle is a powerful, adaptable CRM platform built for teams who've outgrown spreadsheets but find Salesforce overkill.

- **Multi-Team Support** - Securely manage multiple business units with isolated workspaces
- **Modern Technology** - Built on Laravel 12, PHP 8.3, and Filament 4
- **Privacy-Focused** - Self-host with complete data ownership
- **Open Source** - Transparent development with AGPL-3.0 license

**vs Other CRMs:**
- **vs HubSpot/Salesforce:** Self-hosted, no monthly fees, own your data
- **vs SuiteCRM:** Modern Laravel stack, no-code customization, beautiful UI
- **vs Custom Build:** Production-ready, maintained, community-supported
