### Guaranteed legal and secure processing of personal data.

Each client can be sure his personal data will be dealt with honestly and legally. We only use that data for the legitimate reasons outlined above, and we can guarantee that it will always be kept safe from accidental or intentional misuse.

We will never store your personal data for longer than what is necessary. Your data will get archived after a certain time period or when you stop using our services.

We've taken strong technical and organizational measures to keep your personal data secure. They are appropriate to the type of data involved and proportionate to the risk level we're exposed to.

Protecting sensitive data is crucial, so only authorized users can access it. We help with setting up necessary safeguards and monitoring user activity to keep data safe. It is impossible to eliminate all risks. One way we can reduce the likelihood or impact of a breach is by protecting important data and information we have with strong passwords and other protections in place. In any case, if a problem does occur, we will notify you immediately and take precautions to minimize any theft or damage.

## Right to object
Each client can object to the processing of their personal data. This right to object only exists if there are sufficient legitimate and compelling reasons relating to their particular situation. The customer may at any time, free of charge and without further ado, object to the proposed processing of their personal data, if this data was collected for direct marketing purposes.

Each client has the right to object to the processing of their personal data. They have this right if they provide legitimate, compelling reasons regarding their individual situation. You can object to any data processing for marketing purposes at any time without giving reasons.

You also have the right to obtain the deletion and/or prohibition of the use of all your personal data that has been collected and which is incomplete or irrelevant in terms of the purpose of processing. This also applies to any personal data the registration, disclosure, and storage of which is prohibited, or to personal data stored beyond the permitted period. This right can be exercised at any time free of charge and without any additional justification.

Customers must exercise their right by sending a signed written request to Relaticle by registered mail. We will take appropriate action upon request within fifteen (15) business days.

## Right to access
Each client who has confirmed his or her identity has the right to access all information related to the processing of his or her personal data by Relaticle, as defined in the Privacy Act.

## Right to correct
We attach great importance to collecting accurate data. Thus, inaccurate or incomplete personal data can always be corrected or even deleted.

Since we cannot constantly be aware of any errors, incompleteness or falsity of your personal data, you, as a customer, must report inaccuracies or omissions and make the necessary adjustments with respect to your registration data.

If your personal actions seem insufficient, contact us by sending a signed, written and registered request to Relaticle. We perform the necessary actions within 15 working days, making additions, correcting or deleting personal data. Deletion is mainly related to visibility, so it is possible that deleted data will remain temporarily stored.

## Right to forget
Like your right to be corrected, you also have the right to be forgotten. You can ask us to delete all information related to your account and actions from our system.

Only the data that we need to save for legal or tax purposes will be saved.
