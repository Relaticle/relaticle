## Core Concepts

Relaticle organizes your customer data into five connected entities:

| Entity | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Companies** | Organizations you work with | Acme Corporation |
| **People** | Contacts at companies | John Doe, CEO at Acme |
| **Opportunities** | Deals in your sales pipeline | Q1 Enterprise Contract |
| **Tasks** | Actions to complete | Follow up on proposal |
| **Notes** | Important information to remember | Meeting notes from call |

**How they connect:**
- People belong to Companies
